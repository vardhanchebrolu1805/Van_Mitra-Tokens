Van Mitra Tokens (VMT) Integration with Van Mitra Scheme
Overview
The Van Mitra scheme is an environmental initiative by the Government of Haryana aimed at making the state more environmentally sustainable. Under this scheme, community members work to plant and maintain saplings while earning monetary rewards. The Van Mitra Tokens (VMT) integration enhances this program by rewarding users based on their efforts to plant and maintain saplings, fostering a more sustainable and incentivized approach to the initiative.

Problem Statement
The Van Mitra scheme currently rewards community members with monetary incentives for planting saplings and maintaining them over time. However, we aim to introduce an additional feature, Van Mitra Tokens (VMT), which will provide a more structured reward system. These tokens will be based on the survival rate of the saplings planted by users, allowing top contributors to receive rewards in the form of VMT, which can be redeemed for additional saplings.

Goals of the Project
Integrate VMT into the Van Mitra Scheme: Reward users with VMT based on the survival rate of saplings they planted.
Encourage Better Plant Maintenance: By offering VMT as a reward, users will be motivated to maintain saplings and improve their survival rates.
Allow VMT Redemption: Enable users to redeem their VMT for additional saplings, supporting further plantation efforts.
How It Works
1. Van Mitra Scheme
Eligibility: Community members with an annual income of less than ₹1.8 lakhs can participate.
Planting: Participants can plant a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 1000 saplings.
Land Identification: The community members identify empty or unused land (e.g., government lands, open grounds, etc.) for planting.
Pit Digging & Sapling Collection: Participants dig pits and collect saplings from local government-run nurseries.
2. Rewards
Monetary Incentives:
₹20 per pit dug.
₹30 per sapling planted.
Ongoing Maintenance Rewards:
For each surviving sapling:
1st year: ₹10 per surviving sapling.
2nd year: ₹8 per surviving sapling.
3rd year: ₹5 per surviving sapling.
4th year: ₹3 per surviving sapling.
Geotagging: To monitor the health of plants, users must upload photos of the saplings with geotags to the Van Mitra app.
3. Van Mitra Tokens (VMT)
Survival Rate Calculation:
The survival rate of each user is calculated based on the number of surviving saplings at the end of each month.
VMT Distribution:
The top 50 users with the highest survival rates will receive VMT rewards:
1st place: 1000 VMT
2nd place: 950 VMT
3rd place: 900 VMT
Continue decreasing by 50 VMT until the 10th place.
Users ranked 11th to 50th will receive 500 VMT.
VMT Redemption:
10 VMT = 1 sapling.
Users can redeem their VMT for saplings, which they can plant and maintain to continue earning rewards.
Key Features
Smart Contracts: VMT distribution and redemption are automated using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Reward System: The system calculates the survival rate based on the monthly survival data and distributes VMT accordingly.
Geotagging and Monitoring: Integration of geotagging for sapling health tracking.
Incentive Structure: Monetary rewards for sapling maintenance and VMT as an additional incentive for the most dedicated users.
Technologies Used
Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity, Smart Contracts)
Web Development: React.js, Node.js
Database: Smart contracts will store user data, sapling survival rates, and VMT balances.
Geotagging & Image Uploads: Integration with mobile apps for users to upload geotagged images of their saplings.
Future Enhancements
Mobile App Integration: Allow users to track their progress, upload images, and manage their VMT balance directly from a mobile app.
Increased Token Benefits: Expand the VMT rewards to allow for more redemption options, such as redeeming for community benefits or other sustainability-related rewards.
Conclusion
By integrating Van Mitra Tokens (VMT) into the Van Mitra scheme, the initiative aims to provide a more engaging and rewarding experience for community members. This project encourages environmental sustainability while incentivizing participants to actively contribute to the plantation and maintenance of saplings.
